# Contributing to Arduino-DesfireNFC

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Arduino-DesfireNFC as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes if appropriate
2. Update examples if there are API changes
3. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/)
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of another developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you

## Coding Standards

- Follow the Arduino Style Guide for naming conventions
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Write comments for complex logic
- Add Doxygen-style documentation for public API functions
- Write unit tests for new features

## Testing

Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request:

```
pio test
```

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/username/Arduino-DesfireNFC/tags).
